Question
Chef has N slippers, L of which are left slippers and the rest are right slippers. Slippers must always be sold in pairs, where each pair contains one left and one right 
slipper. If each pair of slippers cost X rupees, what is the maximum amount of rupees that Chef can get for these slippers?


Time Complexity: O(1) for each test case
Space Complexity: O(1) for each test case


Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main(void){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
    int t;  cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        ll n, l, c;   cin>>n>>l>>c;
        ll r = n - l;
        
        int pairs = min(l, r);
        
        ll ans = pairs * c;
        cout<<ans<<"\n";
    }
}
