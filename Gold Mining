Question
Chef has decided to go to a gold mine along with N of his friends (thus, total N+1 people including Chef go to the gold mine). The gold mine contains a total of X kg of gold. 
Every person has the capacity of carrying up atmost Y kg of gold. Will Chef and his friends together be able to carry up all the gold from the gold mine assuming that they 
can go to the mine exactly once.


Solution

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const ll INF = 1e9+7;
const ll MOD = 998244353;
typedef pair<ll,ll> ii;
#define iii pair<ll,ii>
#define f(i,a,b) for(ll i = a;i < b;i++)
#define pb push_back
#define vll vector<ll>
#define F first
#define S second
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()

ll mulMod(ll a, ll b){
    ll ans = ((a % MOD) * (b % MOD)) % MOD;
    return ans;
}

ll modPow(ll a, ll b){
        
    ll ans = 1;
    while(b > 0){
        if((b & 1) != 0){
            ans = mulMod(ans, a);
        }
        
        b >>= 1;
        a = mulMod(a, a);
    }
    
    return ans;
}
    
int main(void){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0); 
    cout.tie(0);
    int t;  cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int n, x, y;   cin>>n>>x>>y;
        
	    int max_weight = (n+1) * y;
	    
	    if(max_weight < x){
	        cout<<"NO\n";
	    }
	    else{
            cout<<"YES\n";
	    }
    }
    return 0;
}
