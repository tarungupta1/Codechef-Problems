Question
Chef has decided to go to a gold mine along with N of his friends (thus, total N+1 people including Chef go to the gold mine). The gold mine contains a total of X kg of gold. 
Every person has the capacity of carrying up atmost Y kg of gold. Will Chef and his friends together be able to carry up all the gold from the gold mine assuming that they 
can go to the mine exactly once.


Time Complexity: O(1) for each test case
Space Complexity: O(1) for each test case

Solution

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
    
int main(void){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);     cout.tie(0);
    int t;  cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int n, x, y;   cin>>n>>x>>y;
        
	    int max_weight = (n+1) * y;

	    if(max_weight < x){
		cout<<"NO\n";
	    }
	    else{
		cout<<"YES\n";
	    }
    }
    return 0;
}
