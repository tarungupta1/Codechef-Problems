Question
The Professor is facing the North. Tokyo is in trouble, and she is facing the South. Professor being her guardian angel wants to help her.
So, The Professor will follow some instructions, given as a string S of length N, and will turn either left or right according to these instructions. He can save Tokyo 
only if after following a substring of instructions he will face in the same direction that Tokyo is facing.
Will the Professor be able to save Tokyo?


Time Complexity: O(N) for each test case
Space Complexity: O(1) for each test case

Solution
#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(0);     cout.tie(0);	
	int t;  cin>>t;
	while(t-- > 0){
	    ll n;   cin>>n;
	    cin.ignore();
	    string str;     getline(cin, str);
	    
	    bool tag = false;
	    for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++){
	        if(str[i] == str[i+1]){
	            tag = true;
	            break;
	        }
	    }
	    
	    if(tag){
	        cout<<"YES\n";
	    }
	    else{
	        cout<<"NO\n";
	    }	    
	}
	return 0;
}
