Question
A 5 match test series between India and England has just concluded.
Every match could have ended either as a win for India, a win for England, or a draw. You know the result of all the matches. Determine who won the series or if it ended 
in a draw.
A team is said to have won the series if it wins strictly more test matches than the other team.


Time Complexity: O(1) for each test case
Space Complexity: O(1) for each test case
