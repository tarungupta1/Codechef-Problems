Question
This year Chef is participating in a Dancing competition. The dance performance will be done on a linear stage marked with integral positions. Initially, Chef is present 
at position X and Chef's dance partner is at position Y. Chef can perform two kinds of dance moves.
If Chef is currently at position k, Chef can:
    1. Moonwalk to position k+2, or
    2. Slide to position kâˆ’1
Chef wants to find the minimum number of moves required to reach his partner. Can you help him find this number?

Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
    
int main(void){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);     cout.tie(0);
    int t;  cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        ll x, y;    cin>>x>>y;
        
	    ll diff = abs(x - y);
	    ll ans;
	    if(y < x){
	        ans = diff;
	    }
	    else{
	        ans = (diff / 2) + ((diff % 2) * 2);
	    }
	    
	    cout<<ans<<"\n";
    }
}
