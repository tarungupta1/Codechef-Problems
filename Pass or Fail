Solution

#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(0);     cout.tie(0);
	
	int t;  cin>>t;
	while(t-- > 0){
	    ll n, x, p;     cin>>n>>x>>p;
	    
	    int ans = (x * 3) + ((n - x) * -1);
	    
	    if(ans < p){
	        cout<<"FAIL\n";
	    }
	    else{
	        cout<<"PASS\n";
	    }
