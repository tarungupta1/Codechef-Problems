Question
You are given two positive integers X and K.
You have to output the minimum and maximum value of LCM(i,j) where X≤i<j≤X⋅K.
We define LCM(i,j) for two positive integers i and j as the minimum positive integer y such that both i and j divide y without remainder.

Time Complexity: O(1) for each test case
Space Complexity: O(1) for each test case

Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main(void){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);     cout.tie(0);
    int t;  cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        ll x, k;    cin>>x>>k;
        
        ll right = x * k;
        ll minimum = x * 2;
        ll maximum = right * (right-1);

        cout<<minimum<<" "<<maximum<<"\n";
    }
}
